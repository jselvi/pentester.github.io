<br>My name is Jose Selvi, I have been working in different fields of the infosec industry since 2004. Most of this time I have been focused on Penetration Testing, Security Assessments and Security Research. However, I also had the opportunity to work on other fields such as Intrusion Detection, Intelligence, Incident Response and Forensics.

I'm Executive Principal Consultant at [NCC Group](https://www.nccgroup.com), where I deliver all kind of technical security assessments around the world. In addition, I usually contribute to security tools and I do research on new techniques when I have some spare time.
